## Support

If you run into an issue or require technical support, please first look through the closed and open **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/slapbot/stephanie-va/issues)**, as you may find a solution there (or some useful advice, at least).

If you're still having trouble, the next place to look would be the new **[Subreddit Stephanie](https://www.reddit.com/r/StephanieAssistant)**, as well as [Quora Stephanie](https://www.quora.com/topic/Stephanie-Virtual-Assistant). If your problem even still remains unsolved, contact me personally through a message on any of social networks like [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Drazier), [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ujjwal-Gupta-31), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/drazxie). (Not too sure about facebook because of their spam filter, so consider quora or reddit as first choice.)

## Contact

If you are looking for just a casual conversation about Stephanie or anything related to bugs/feedback or just anything contact me through social network links like [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Drazier), [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ujjwal-Gupta-31), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/drazxie), where as for any formal enquiries or serious discussion consider dropping me a mail at ugupta41@gmail.com
