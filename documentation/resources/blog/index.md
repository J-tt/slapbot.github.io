# Don't click.

Come on mate, you had one job, no seriously. One job. To be honest in this place, I will just mess around, like some kind of personal blog but I'll keep updating it once in a while and by update I mean replace whatever I write here frequently.

## REDDIT AMA!

I am doing an AMA in reddit, come ask any question! /u/drazxie

## Sup?

I don't know honestly, since I am 18 years old right now, and didn't go to college (nor planning to, I believe I could get lots of job/learning done without going in one, especially the way it frees you from so much time, like hell I can pick up a book on Economics this monday and finish it by thursday or just some good ol Algorithms book and finish in a day or two since I have no other work, start a new personal project, and end it in a week, create a cool new library, possibilities are just endless), I always feel it would had been cool if I had few like minded friends to discuss about latest technology, projects, career advises and whatnot. So if you're bored or something, just drop me a message in any of the social media platforms.

If you wanna work for some kind of stupid, fun, personal, side project together, just brainstorm an idea, talk about programming or duh, like anything just join along, and hopefully we'll have fun. Cool, that's it for now.

Cheers.
